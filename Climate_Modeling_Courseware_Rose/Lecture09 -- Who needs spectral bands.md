## 1. What if CO$_2$ actually behaved like a Grey Gas?
____________

Suppose that CO$_2$ actually behaved as a grey gas. In other words, no spectral dependence in absorptivity.

If we then **double the CO2 concentration** in the atmosphere, we double the number of absorbers. This should imply that we also **double the absorption cross-section**:

$$ \kappa^\prime = 2 ~ \kappa $$

This would imply that we **double the optical thickness of every layer**:

$$ \Delta \tau^\prime  = 2 \left( -\frac{\kappa}{g} \Delta p \right) = 2 ~ \Delta \tau$$ 

And since (from [Lecture 8](./Lecture08 -- Modeling non-scattering radiative transfer.ipynb)) the absorptivity / emissivity of each layer is

$$  \epsilon = 1 - \exp\big( - \Delta \tau \big)  $$

the **modified absorptivity** is

$$ \epsilon^\prime = 1 - \exp\big( - 2\Delta \tau \big) = 1 - \left( \exp\big( - \Delta \tau \big)\right)^2 = 1 - (1-\epsilon)^2 $$
or simply
$$ \epsilon^\prime = 2 \epsilon  - \epsilon^2 $$

(Note that $\epsilon^\prime = 2 \epsilon$ for very thin layers, for which $\epsilon$ is small).

### What does our 2-layer analytical model then say about the radiative forcing?

Recall that we tuned the two-layer model with

$$ \epsilon = 0.586 $$

to get the observed OLR with observed temperatures.


```python
#  Applying the above formula
eps = 0.586
print 'Doubling a grey gas absorber would \
       change the absorptivity from {:.3} \
       to {:.3}'.format(eps, 2*eps - eps**2)
```

    Doubling a grey gas absorber would        change the absorptivity from 0.586        to 0.829


**If CO2 behaved like a grey gas**, doubling it would cause a huge increase in the absorptivity of each layer!

Back in [Lecture 6]('Lecture06 -- Elementary greenhouse models.ipynb') we worked out that the radiative forcing in this model (with the observed lapse rate) is about +2.2 W m$^{-2}$ for an increase of 0.01 in $\epsilon$.

**This means that our hypothetical doubling of "grey CO$_2$" should yield a radiative forcing of 53.5 W m$^{-2}$.** 

This is an absolutely enormous number. Assuming a net climate feedback of -1.3 W m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$
(consistent with the AR5 ensemble)
would then give us an **equilibrium climate sensitivity of 41 K**.

### Conclusions:

1. **If CO2 did behave like a grey gas, we would be toast.**
2. The Grey Gas model is insufficient for understanding radiative forcing and feedback.

## 2. Another look at observed spectra
____________

It's time to move away from the Grey Gas approximation and look more carefully at the actual observed spectra of solar and terrestrial radiation.

### Observed solar spectra

The following figure shows observed spectra of solar radiation at TOA and at the surface, along with the theoretical Planck function for a blackbody at 5525 K.


```python
from IPython.display import Image
Image('../images/Solar_spectrum.png')
```

> This figure shows the solar radiation spectrum for direct light at both the top of the Earth's atmosphere and at sea level. The sun produces light with a distribution similar to what would be expected from a 5525 K (5250 Â°C) blackbody, which is approximately the sun's surface temperature. As light passes through the atmosphere, some is absorbed by gases with specific absorption bands. Additional light is redistributed by Raleigh scattering, which is responsible for the atmosphere's blue color. These curves are based on the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Terrestrial Reference Spectra, which are standards adopted by the photovoltaics industry to ensure consistent test conditions and are similar to the light that could be expected in North America. Regions for ultraviolet, visible and infrared light are indicated.

- The figure shows that that the incident beam at TOA has the shape of a blackbody radiator. 
- By the time the beam arrives at the surface, it is strongly depleted at specific wavelengths.
- Absorption by O$_3$ (ozone) depletes almost the entire ultraviolet spectrum.
- Weaker absorption features, mostly due to H$_2$O, deplete some parts of the near-infrared.
- Note that the depletion in the visible band is mostly due to scattering, which depletes the direct beam but contributes diffuse radiation (so we can still see when it's cloudy!)

### Observed terrestrial spectra

This figure shows the Planck function for Earth's surface temperature compared with the spectrum observed from space.

Careful: I'm pretty sure what is plotted here is not the **total** observed spectrum, but rather the part of the **emissions from the surface** that **actual make it out to space**.

As we now, the terrestrial beam from the surface is depleted by absorption by many greenhouse gases, but principally CO$_2$ and H$_2$O.

However there is a spectral band centered on 10 $\mu$m in which the greenhouse effect is very weak. This is the so-called **window region** in the spectrum.

Since absorption is so strong across most of the rest of the infrared spectrum, this window region is a key determinant of the overall greenhouse effect.

#### One very big shortcoming of the Grey Gas model: it ignores the window region

We would therefore like to start using a model that includes enough spectral information that it represents

- the mostly strong CO2 absorption outside the window region
- the weak absorption inside the window region

## 3. Water vapor changes under global warming
____________

Another big shortcoming of the Grey Gas model is that it cannot represent the **water vapor feedback**.

We have seen above that H$_2$O is an important absorber in both longwave and shortwave spectra.

We also know that the water vapor load in the atmosphere increases as the climate warms. The primary reason is that the **saturation vapor pressure** increases strongly with temperature.

### Evidence from CESM simulations

Let's take at changes in the mean water vapor fields in the CESM model after a doubling of CO$_2$

### What do you see here?

- Where does the largest warming occur?
- Where does the largest moistening occur?

In fact the specific humidity anomaly has roughly the same shape of the specific humidity field itself -- **it is largest where the temperature is highest**. This is a consequence of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation.

The **relative humidity** anomaly is

- overall rather small (just a few percent)
- Largest in places cold places where the specific humidity is very small.

The smallness of the relative humidity change is a rather remarkable result.

This is not something we can derive from first principles. It is an emergent property of the GCMs. However it is a very robust feature of global warming simulations.

## 4. A simple water vapor parameterization
____________

### A credible climate model needs a water vapor feedback

If relative humidity is nearly constant under global warming, and water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this implies a positive feedback that will amplify the warming for a given radiative forcing.

Thus far our simple models have ignored this process, and we have not been able to use them to assess the climate sensitivity.

To proceed towards more realistic models, we have two options:

- **Simulate** all the evaporation, condensation and transport processes that determine the time-mean water vapor field (as is done in the CESM).
- **Parameterize** the dependence of water vapor on temperature by insisting that relative humidity stays constant as the climate changes.

We will now explore this second option, so that we can continue to think of the global energy budget under climate change as a process occurring in a single column.

### Manabe's constant relative humidity parameterization

We are going to adopt a parameterization first used in a very famous paper:

> Manabe, S. and Wetherald, R. T. (1967). Thermal equilibrium of the atmosphere with a given distribution of relative humidity. J. Atmos. Sci., 24(3):241â259.

This paper was the first to give a really credible calculation of climate sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 by accounting for the known spectral properties of CO2 and H2O absorption, as well as the water vapor feedback!

The parameterization is very simple:

We assume that the relative humidity $r$ is a linear function of pressure $p$:

$$ r = r_s \left( \frac{p/p_s - 0.02}{1 - 0.02} \right) $$

where $p_s = 1000$ hPa is the surface pressure, and $r_s$ is a prescribed surface value of relative humidity. Manabe and Wetherald set $r_s = 0.77$, but we should consider this a tunable parameter in our parameterization.

Since this formula gives a negative number above 20 hPa, we also assume that the **specific humidity** has a minimum value of $0.005$ g/kg (a typical stratospheric value).

This formula is implemented in `climlab.radiation.ManabeWaterVapor()`

Using this parameterization, the surface and tropospheric specific humidity will always increase as the temperature increases.

## 5. Modeling spectral bands with the `climlab.BandRCModel` process
____________

Here is a brief introduction to the `climlab.BandRCModel` process.

This is a model that divides the spectrum into 7 distinct bands: three shortwave and four longwave.

As we will see, the process works much like the familiar `climlab.RadiativeConvectiveModel`.

## About the spectra

### Shortwave

The shortwave is divided into three channels:

- Channel 0 is the Hartley and Huggins band (extreme UV, 200 - 340 nm, 1% of total flux, strong ozone absorption)
- Channel 1 is Chappuis band (450 - 800 nm, 27% of total flux, moderate ozone absorption)
- Channel 2 is remaining radiation (72% of total flux, largely in the visible range, no ozone absorption)




### Longwave

The longwave is divided into four bands:

- Band 0 is the **window region** (between 8.5 and 11 $\mu$m), 17% of total flux.
- Band 1 is the CO2 absorption channel (the band of strong absorption by CO2 around 15 $\mu$m), 15% of total flux
- Band 2 is a weak water vapor absorption channel, 35% of total flux
- Band 3 is a strong water vapor absorption channel, 33% of total flux

The longwave decomposition is not as easily related to specific wavelengths, as in reality there is a lot of overlap between H$_2$O and CO$_2$ absorption features (as well as absorption by other greenhouse gases such as CH$_4$ and N$_2$O that we are not representing).

### Example usage of the spectral model


```python
import climlab
from climlab import constants as const
```

First try a model with all default parameters. Usage is very similar to the familiar `RadiativeConvectiveModel`.


```python
col1 = climlab.BandRCModel()
print col1
```

    climlab Process of type <class 'climlab.model.column.BandRCModel'>. 
    State variables and domain shapes: 
      Tatm: (30,) 
      Ts: (1,) 
    The subprocess tree: 
    top: <class 'climlab.model.column.BandRCModel'>
       LW: <class 'climlab.radiation.nband.FourBandLW'>
       H2O: <class 'climlab.radiation.water_vapor.ManabeWaterVapor'>
       convective adjustment: <class 'climlab.convection.convadj.ConvectiveAdjustment'>
       SW: <class 'climlab.radiation.nband.ThreeBandSW'>
       insolation: <class 'climlab.radiation.insolation.FixedInsolation'>
    


Check out the list of subprocesses.

We now have a process called `H2O`, in addition to things we've seen before.

The state variables are still just temperatures:


```python
col1.state
```




    {'Tatm': Field([ 200.        ,  202.68965517,  205.37931034,  208.06896552,
             210.75862069,  213.44827586,  216.13793103,  218.82758621,
             221.51724138,  224.20689655,  226.89655172,  229.5862069 ,
             232.27586207,  234.96551724,  237.65517241,  240.34482759,
             243.03448276,  245.72413793,  248.4137931 ,  251.10344828,
             253.79310345,  256.48275862,  259.17241379,  261.86206897,
             264.55172414,  267.24137931,  269.93103448,  272.62068966,
             275.31034483,  278.        ]), 'Ts': Field([ 288.])}



But the model has a new input field for specific humidity:


```python
col1.q
```




    Field([  8.89713063e-05,   4.39167697e-05,   3.85535194e-05,
             3.98322776e-05,   4.43229433e-05,   5.13409779e-05,
             6.08897166e-05,   7.32583372e-05,   8.89132077e-05,

             1.98876078e-04,   2.43202440e-04,   2.96905700e-04,
             3.61688778e-04,   4.39513233e-04,   5.32627950e-04,
             6.43599888e-04,   7.75346828e-04,   9.31172043e-04,

             1.87690860e-03,   2.21882122e-03,   2.61489241e-03,
             3.07223966e-03,   3.59870220e-03,   4.20288866e-03])



The `H2O` process sets the specific humidity field at every timestep to a specified profile, determined by air temperatures. More on that below. For now, let's compute a radiative equilibrium state.


```python
col1.integrate_years(2)
```

    Integrating for 730 steps, 730.4844 days, or 2 years.
    Total elapsed time is 1.99867375676 years.



```python
# Check for energy balance
col1.ASR - col1.OLR
```




    array([-0.00150116])




```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot( col1.Tatm, col1.lev, 'c-', label='default' )
ax.plot( col1.Ts, climlab.constants.ps, 'co', markersize=16 )
ax.invert_yaxis()
ax.set_xlabel('Temperature (K)', fontsize=16)
ax.set_ylabel('Pressure (hPa)', fontsize=16 )
ax.set_title('Temperature profiles', fontsize = 18)
ax.grid()

```

By default this model has convective adjustment.  We can set the adjusted lapse rate by passing a parameter when we create the model.

The model currently has no ozone (so there is no stratosphere). Not very realistic!


### About the radiatively active gases

The Band model is aware of three different absorbing gases: O3 (ozone), CO2, and H2O (water vapor). The abundances of these gases are stored in a dictionary of arrays as follows:


```python
col1.absorber_vmr
```




    {'CO2': Field([ 0.00038,  0.00038,  0.00038,  0.00038,  0.00038,  0.00038,

Ozone and CO2 are both specified in the model. The default, as you see above, is zero ozone, and constant (well-mixed) CO2 at a volume mixing ratio of 3.8E-4 or 380 ppm.

Water vapor is handled differently: it is determined by the model at each timestep. We make the following assumptions, following a classic paper on radiative-convective equilibrium by Manabe and Wetherald (J. Atmos. Sci. 1967):

- the relative humidity just above the surface is fixed at 77% (can be changed of course... see the parameter `col1.relative_humidity`
- water vapor drops off linearly with pressure
- there is a small specified amount of water vapor in the stratosphere.

## Putting in some ozone

We need to provide some ozone data to the model in order to simulate a stratosphere. We will read in some ozone data just as we did in [Lecture 7](Lecture07 -- Grey radiation modeling with climlab.ipynb).


```python
ozone = xr.open_dataset( datapath + 'som_input/ozone_1.9x2.5_L26_2000clim_c091112.nc' + endstr )
```


```python
#  Take global, annual average and convert to Kelvin
weight_ozone = cos(deg2rad(ozone.lat)) / cos(deg2rad(ozone.lat)).mean(dim='lat')
O3_global = (ozone.O3 * weight_ozone).mean(dim=('lat','lon','time'))
print O3_global
```

We are going to create another instance of the model, this time using the same vertical coordinates as the ozone data.


```python
#  Create the column with appropriate vertical coordinate, surface albedo and convective adjustment
col2 = climlab.BandRCModel(lev=ozone.lev)
print col2
```

    climlab Process of type <class 'climlab.model.column.BandRCModel'>. 
    State variables and domain shapes: 
      Tatm: (26,) 
      Ts: (1,) 
    The subprocess tree: 
    top: <class 'climlab.model.column.BandRCModel'>
       LW: <class 'climlab.radiation.nband.FourBandLW'>
       H2O: <class 'climlab.radiation.water_vapor.ManabeWaterVapor'>
       convective adjustment: <class 'climlab.convection.convadj.ConvectiveAdjustment'>
       SW: <class 'climlab.radiation.nband.ThreeBandSW'>
       insolation: <class 'climlab.radiation.insolation.FixedInsolation'>
    



```python
#  Set the ozone mixing ratio
col2.absorber_vmr['O3'] = O3_global.values
```


```python
#  Run the model out to equilibrium!
col2.integrate_years(2.)
```

    Integrating for 730 steps, 730.4844 days, or 2.0 years.
    Total elapsed time is 1.99867375676 years.



```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

Once we include ozone we get a well-defined stratosphere. 

Things to consider / try:

- Here we used the global annual mean Q = 341.3 W m$^{-2}$. We might want to consider latitudinal or seasonal variations in Q.
- We also used the global annual mean ozone profile! Ozone varies tremendously in latitude and by season. That information is all contained in the ozone data file we opened above. We might explore the effects of those variations.
- We can calculate climate sensitivity in this model by doubling the CO2 concentration and re-running out to the new equilibrium. Does the amount of ozone affect the climate sensitivity?  (example below)
- An important shortcoming of the model: there are no clouds! (that would be the next step in the hierarchy of column models)
- Clouds would act both in the shortwave (increasing the albedo, cooling the climate) and in the longwave (greenhouse effect, warming the climate). Which effect is stronger depends on the vertical structure of the clouds (high or low clouds) and their optical properties (e.g. thin cirrus clouds are nearly transparent to solar radiation but are good longwave absorbers).


```python
col3 = climlab.process_like(col2)
print col3
```

    climlab Process of type <class 'climlab.model.column.BandRCModel'>.

```python
# Let's double CO2.
col3.absorber_vmr['CO2'] *= 2.
```


```python
col3.compute_diagnostics()
print 'The radiative forcing for doubling CO2 is %f W/m2.' % (col2.diagnostics['OLR'] - col3.diagnostics['OLR'])
```

    The radiative forcing for doubling CO2 is 1.390281 W/m2.



```python
col3.integrate_years(3)
```

    Integrating for 1095 steps, 1095.7266 days, or 3 years.
    Total elapsed time is 4.99668439189 years.



```python
col3.ASR - col3.OLR
```




    array([  4.31208178e-07])




```python
print 'The Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity is %f K.' % (col3.Ts - col2.Ts)
```

    The Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity is 2.790202 K.



```python
#  An example with no ozone
col4 = climlab.process_like(col1)
print col4
```

    climlab Process of type <class 'climlab.model.column.BandRCModel'>. 
    State variables and domain shapes:

col4.absorber_vmr['CO2'] *= 2.
col4.compute_diagnostics()
print 'The radiative forcing for doubling CO2 is %f W/m2.' % (col1.OLR - col4.OLR)
```

    The radiative forcing for doubling CO2 is 4.421099 W/m2.



```python
col4.integrate_years(3.)
col4.ASR - col4.OLR
```

    Integrating for 1095 steps, 1095.7266 days, or 3.0 years.
    Total elapsed time is 4.99668439189 years.





    array([ -5.32160527e-07])




```python
print 'The Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity is %f K.' % (col4.Ts - col1.Ts)
```

    The Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity is 3.180993 K.


Interesting that the model is MORE sensitive when ozone is set to zero.
