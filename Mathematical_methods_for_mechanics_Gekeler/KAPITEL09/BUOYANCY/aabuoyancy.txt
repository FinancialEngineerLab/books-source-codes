Kapitel IX/BUOYANVY
Navier-Stokes problems in velocity-pressure form
and heat convection
Programs run also without MATLAB TOOLBOX (OPTION_MESH = 1)
demo1.m: thermal Flow in a cup 
         stationary problem without convection term 
demo2.m: convection in a square box
         stationary without convection term
demo3.m: Benard Cell
         stationary without convection term
demo4.m: thermal Flow in a cup
         non-stationary with convection term
         DAE problem with semi-explicit Runge-Kutta method
demo5.m: same as demo4.m but with specified heat radiation on surface of water
demo6.m: convection in a square box
         non-stationary with convection term
         DAE problem with semi-explicit Runge-Kutta method
demo7.m: Benard cell
         non-stationary with convection term 
         DAE problem with semi-explicit Runge-Kutta method
