% Elliptiboundary value problems of econd order
% Essentially, the FORTRAN programs of H.R.Schwarz are transponed
% to MATLAB programs here with simplifying modififactions
% p,e,t have the same form as in the MATLAB PDE TOOLBOX:
% p(1:2,:) : x- and y- coordinates of nodes
% e(1:5,:) : boundary see e.g. bsp001g.m
% t(1:3,:) : triangles ( numbers of nodes counterclockwise)
% q(1:4,:) : Parallelogram elements
% The boundary conditions have the same form as in PDE TOOLBOX
% Sometimes MATLAB PDE TOOLBOX is used
% ATTENTION: Make first path to AAMESH!
