Kapitel XI/STOKES, 
Stationary Navier-Stokes problems in velocity-pressure form
All examples besides demo2.m use the Taylor-Hood element
but some consider only the linear problem
Specify one value of pressure p! but see DEMO1.M
Programs run also without MATLAB TOOLBOX (OPTION_MESH = 1)
demo1.m: lid driven cavity, without convection term
         vers. 1: one value of p specified,
         vers. 2: no value of p specified, very slow
demo2.m: lid driven cavity with Mini elements
         without convection term
demo3.m: flow past half cylinder without convection term
demo4.m: lid driven cavity with convection term
         simple iteration
         bad values for pressure, NU = 0.1;
         restart with NU = 0.05 and NU = 0.025
demo5.m: example with exact solutionin unit square
         without convection term
demo6.m: lid driven cavity with convection term
         NEWTON iteration
         New start with NU = 0.01; 
         restart with NU = 0.005, NU = 0.001 and NU = 0.0005 
demo7.m: same as demo6.m but leading matrix augmented by 
         boundary conditions for exact gradient in Newton method 
dem08.m as demo6.m but modifications to save memory 
         for an additional mesh refinement 
demo9.m  lid driven cavity with convection term
         unsteady problem 
         DAE problem with semi-explicit Runge-Kutta method
demo11.m: flow past half cylinder with convection term
          NEWTON iteration
demo13.m: flow past cylinder with convection term
          Newton iteration
demo14.m: letters F E M without convection term
demo15.m: backfacing step with convection term
          Newton iteration
ellipt_post.m: post prozessor for computation of stream lines
