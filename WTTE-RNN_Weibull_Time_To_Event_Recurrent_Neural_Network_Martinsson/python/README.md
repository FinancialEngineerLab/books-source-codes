# WTTE-RNN
Weibull Time To Event Reccurent Neural Network

A less hacky machine-learning framework for churn- and time to event
prediction. Forecasting problems as diverse as server monitoring to
earthquake- and churn-prediction can be posed as the problem of
predicting the time to an event. WTTE-RNN is an algorithm and a
philosophy about how this should be done.
